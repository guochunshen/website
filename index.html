    <p>I'm Guochun Shen, an assistant professor in the <a href="http://tiantong.ecnu.edu.cn/">Tiantong National Station of Forest Ecosystem</a>, at East China Normal University, Shanghai. Our group focus on how and why species, especially subtropical forest trees, coexist in heterogeneous environments. What are the main ecological, evolutionary processes, and their relative importance in determining current spatial dispersions of species? How can we accurately and robustly detect, estimate effects of abotic habitat, dispersal, individual interaction on community structures from spatial explicitly perspective.</p>
